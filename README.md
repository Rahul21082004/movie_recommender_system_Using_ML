## Introduction
This project is designed to recommend movies to users based on their preferences. The backend leverages NLP and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict user interests, while the frontend is built using Streamlit for a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Features
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user input.
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.
- Utilizes NLTK for natural language processing.
- Machine learning models trained to predict and suggest movies.
- Persistence of trained models using Pickle for efficient loading and inference.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used.
- **NLTK**: Natural Language Toolkit, used for text processing and NLP tasks.
- **Pickle**: For serializing and deserializing the machine learning models.
- **Machine Learning**: Techniques and algorithms for training the recommendation models.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based frontend interface.

## Setup Instructions
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system.git
    cd movie-recommender-system
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage
1. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Enter your movie preferences or other relevant input in the provided fields.
3. Get personalized movie recommendations instantly.
